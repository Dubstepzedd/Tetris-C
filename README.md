# Tetris-C

## Description
This is a simple console based Tetris game that is developed in C. The game is supported on Unix and Windows.

## Build

As of now, the project can be built using [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

For Linux you will need to download ncurses.h before building which you can do with the following command:

`sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev`

For Windows, nothing is required.

Feel free to download and build it yourself!

## Missing features

The game lacks the following:
* A score system
* The correct ["bag system"](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Random_Generator)

These might be added in the future.
